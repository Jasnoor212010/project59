    <h1> MY FAVOURITE HOBBY IS SIGNING </h1>
    <p> I love English Music. Music is the best option for everyone to be happy and busy in the life. In such a busy, crowded and corrupted world where everyone wants to hurt anybody anytime, music plays a great role in making us happy in our difficult time and give lots of relief to our mind.</p>
    <p>I realized in my real life that music is a great tool of being happy always. Music is more than the meditation and yoga as it benefits a lot to both body and mind. We can listen music anytime all through the day. It is very good habit to listen music. Music is defined as the sounds which are pleasant to our ears.</p>
    <p>However this is just the definition according to physics.In real life,what is music to some may be noise to someone else.Music is something which comforts someone's years to be perfect. People developed music since ancient times.Kings were impressed by musicians and every Kingdom had musicians.</p>
    <p>There were sessions devoted to this Art.

Music were usually vocal but in the medieval times,musical instruments were developed and this supported vocals.In modern times,there is even electrical music (EDM).Rock,pop and everything mixed up in a tiny Earth like this.</p>

<p>Music sadly is used nowadays for pure profit.Bollywood uses half of them for item songs trying to capture a wider audience through Youtube and generate higher revenue.Music is filled with curse words to entertain people who are bored of simple words.</p>

<p>Still there are existing legendary artists.Still some people love music and treat it as a form of Art.Music helps to release a lot of stress and comforts a part of our brain which aids in hearing.Not only that ,it helps to release.</p>
